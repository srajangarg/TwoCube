# TwoCube

A small project done by me and my teammates. It's a number puzzle game, with the combined elements of both 2048 and Tetris. The game was made using the Unity 3D Game Engine.

It bagged the first position at Lenovo's GameJam competition and second place at Microsoft's Code.Fun.Do at IIT Bombay, 2016.
